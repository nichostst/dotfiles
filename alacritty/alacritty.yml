  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for

    # Faux Scrolling
    #
    # The `faux_multiplier` setting controls the number of lines the terminal
    # should scroll when the alternate screen buffer is active. This is used
    # to allow mouse scrolling for applications like `man`.
    #
    # Specifying `0` will disable faux scrolling.
  
  # Spaces per Tab (changes require restart)
  #
  # This setting defines the width of a tab in cells.
  #
  # Some applications, like Emacs, rely on knowing about the width of a tab.
  # To prevent unexpected behavior in these applications, it's also required to
  # change the `it` value in terminfo when altering this setting.
